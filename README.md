# Homepagev2

This is the Angular version of my homepage - [http://balev.eu](http://balev.eu).

You can browse it online. If you are curious you can download it locally.
You will need to have `npm` and the Angular CLI installed.
Then start by executing `npm istall` and `ng serve` for spinning a local dev server.
The page will be available at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/). 
If you see some issues please submit these to me [here](https://github.com/luchob/homepagev2/issues).

The older version of the page was implemented with Bootstrap and is
available [here](https://github.com/luchob/homepage).
